          <h1>How to Make Money From Your Parking Lot</h1>
          <p>Parking lots are often overlooked as investment assets, but the right approach can turn asphalt into a steady profit center. This flagship guide covers everything from monetization models and pricing strategies to enforcement and long-term ROI.</p>
          <h2>Monetization Models</h2>
          <p>Choose between hourly, daily, event-based, or monthly passes depending on your market. Hybrid approaches work well for mixed-demand locations.</p>
          <h2>Pricing That Drives Occupancy</h2>
          <p>Survey competitors, track fill rates, and experiment with dynamic pricing. AI systems can automatically adjust rates to capture peak demand while filling slow periods.</p>
          <h2>Automated Enforcement</h2>
          <p>Without enforcement, 20–30% of potential revenue is lost. AI-powered enforcement ensures compliance with license plate recognition, photo evidence, and online payments — no attendants or gate arms required.</p>
          <h2>ROI Example</h2>
          <p>A 50-space lot, priced at $5/day with 60% occupancy, makes about $4,500/month. With AI enforcement improving compliance and pricing optimization, that same lot can generate $6,000+ monthly. Over a year, that’s an $18,000+ gain.</p>

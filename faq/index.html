Be sure to verify your local city and county regulations, as these will determine the exact steps you must follow. It’s also important to clearly post your rules and fees.

We evaluate those factors and recommend the mix that fits, so operations run smoother, manual work drops, reporting is clear, and revenue grows without unnecessary complexity."

Instead, it depends on factors such as local demand, land value, operational costs (maintenance, security, technology), and overall revenue potential. A parking lot in a high-traffic area with steady demand is more likely to generate enough income to cover operating expenses and deliver profit. With the right technology in place, even lots as small as five spaces can produce meaningful revenue, and the larger the lot, the greater the earning potential."

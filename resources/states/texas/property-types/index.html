          <p>Mixed-use developments perform exceptionally well across all three markets. Austin's urban core, Waco's downtown revitalization areas, and Corpus Christi's waterfront districts all feature properties where residential, retail, and office tenants share parking infrastructure. Monetizing visitor and overflow parking protects tenant access while generating new revenue.</p>

          <p>Retail centers, particularly in suburban locations, represent significant untapped opportunity. Texas retail developments typically feature oversized parking lots designed for peak holiday shopping. Most of the year, substantial capacity sits unused. Weekend and evening monetization captures value without affecting primary retail customers.</p>

          <p>Office complexes in suburban business parks often have parking lots that empty after 6 PM and sit vacant on weekends. Properties near entertainment districts, restaurants, or event venues can monetize this off-hours capacity. We've seen Texas office properties generate meaningful revenue from evening and weekend parking that previously produced nothing.</p>

          <p>Multifamily properties continue growing across Texas markets. New apartment complexes often include visitor parking and guest spaces that see irregular use. Monetizing these areas during peak demand periods creates revenue while maintaining availability for legitimate guests through technology-enabled guest validation.</p>

          <p>Medical facilities warrant special attention in Texas. Waco's medical district growth, Austin's healthcare expansion, and Corpus Christi's regional medical center all feature parking challenges. Visitor parking monetization helps healthcare properties manage capacity while generating revenue to offset parking infrastructure costs.</p>

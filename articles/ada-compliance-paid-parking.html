<p>ADA compliance is not optional for parking lots open to the public, and violations carry penalties ranging from $75,000 for first offenses to $150,000 for subsequent violations. Property owners monetizing parking must meet federal accessibility requirements regardless of lot size.</p>

<h2>Required Number of Accessible Spaces</h2>
<p>The number of accessible spaces depends on total lot capacity. Lots with 1-25 spaces require one accessible space. Lots with 26-50 spaces require two. The requirements increase as capacity grows.</p>
<p>For 51-75 spaces, you need three accessible spaces. For 76-100 spaces, you need four. For 101-150 spaces, you need five. Beyond 150 spaces, add one accessible space per additional 25 spaces.</p>
<p>Calculate based on total capacity, not average utilization.</p>

<h2>Van-Accessible Space Requirements</h2>
<p>One out of every six accessible spaces must be van-accessible. Van-accessible spaces need access aisles at least 96 inches wide. Standard accessible spaces need 60-inch access aisles.</p>
<p>The access aisle can be shared between two accessible spaces if properly marked. Access aisles must be level, clearly marked, and part of an accessible route to the entrance or payment system.</p>

<h2>Location and Surface Requirements</h2>
<p>Accessible spaces must be located on the shortest accessible route to the facility entrance. For paid parking lots, locate accessible spaces closest to payment kiosks, elevators, or pedestrian exits.</p>
<p>Surfaces must be stable, firm, and slip-resistant. Gravel or grass lots do not meet ADA requirements. Accessible spaces need paved surfaces with slopes no greater than 2% grade.</p>
<p>Potholes or deteriorated pavement in accessible spaces create compliance issues.</p>

<h2>Signage and Marking Standards</h2>
<p>Each accessible space requires a sign displaying the International Symbol of Accessibility mounted at least 60 inches above the ground. This height prevents parked vehicles from obscuring the sign.</p>
<p>Van-accessible spaces require additional "Van Accessible" text below the symbol.</p>
<p>Ground markings alone do not satisfy ADA requirements. Vertical signage is mandatory. Signs must remain visible and legible.</p>

<h2>Payment System Accessibility</h2>
<p>Payment kiosks must have controls positioned within 48 inches for forward approach or 54 inches for side approach. Touchscreens and card readers must be within these reach ranges.</p>
<p>Kiosks must provide tactile buttons or audio assistance for customers with visual impairments. QR code payment systems meet accessibility standards when codes are positioned at accessible heights.</p>

<h2>Enforcement in Accessible Spaces</h2>
<p>Property owners can enforce payment requirements in accessible spaces. Customers with disabled placards must still pay unless your policy specifically exempts them. ADA does not require free parking for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions prohibit charging disabled placard holders. Check local laws before implementing payment requirements for accessible spaces.</p>
<p>Customers parking in accessible spaces without disabled credentials should be cited according to <a href="/articles/parking-violations-and-enforcement/">local regulations</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Violations and How to Avoid Them</h2>
<p>Common ADA parking violations include insufficient accessible spaces, missing or improperly mounted signage, blocked access aisles, and inaccessible payment systems.</p>
<p>Conduct quarterly audits checking accessible space count, signage condition, surface quality, and access aisle clearance. Document compliance with photos.</p>
<p>ADA compliance protects your customers and your business from violations carrying substantial penalties.</p>

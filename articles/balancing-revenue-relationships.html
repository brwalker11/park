<h2>The Hidden Cost of Charging Your Own People</h2>
<p>You implement parking fees and suddenly your office manager is paying $120/month to come to work. Your tenants are getting tickets. Your maintenance crew is confused about whether they're supposed to pay.</p>
<p>The revenue looks good on paper, but you've created a morale problem. The solution isn't skipping parking monetization. It's implementing policies that separate revenue generation from relationship management.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Who Should Never Pay</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-time employees:</strong> They work for you. Charging them to park effectively reduces their compensation. Exempt them completely.</li>
<li><strong>Building tenants:</strong> They're already paying rent. Parking should be included or offered at a fixed monthly rate.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly reserved spot holders:</strong> They've paid for the privilege. Don't double-charge them.</li>
<li><strong>Regular contractors:</strong> Your HVAC company, cleaning crew, landscapers. They're part of your property's operations.</li>
<li><strong>Property management staff:</strong> Anyone managing or maintaining the property parks free, always.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Who Should Pay</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visitors of tenants/employees:</strong> Your tenant's client visiting for a meeting? They pay. This is where you generate revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Occasional vendors:</strong> One-time delivery, annual inspection, visiting consultant. Not regular enough to warrant exemption.</li>
<li><strong>Event attendees:</strong> Anyone coming for an event, meeting, or service pays standard rates.</li>
<li><strong>After-hours personal use:</strong> If your employee wants to park overnight for a downtown concert, that's personal use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting Up Clear Policies</h2>

<h3>Document Everything</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who is exempt and why</li>
<li>How exemptions are granted</li>
<li>Process for adding/removing vehicles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communicate Before Enforcement Starts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Email all employees and tenants two weeks before go-live</li>
<li>Explain the exemption process</li>
<li>Provide clear instructions on registering plates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Make Requests Simple</h3>
<ul>
<li>Online form or email submission</li>
<li>24-hour processing time</li>
<li>Confirmation when plates are added</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Handling Common Questions</h2>
<p><strong>"Can my spouse park free when they visit?"</strong><br>
No, unless dropping off/picking up immediately. Visits are visitor parking.</p>

<p><strong>"I forgot to register my new car and got charged."</strong><br>
One-time courtesy refund after they register. After that, their responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>"The delivery driver got a ticket."</strong><br>
Regular weekly deliveries: Add to exemptions. One-time: They pay or you validate afterward.</p>

<p><strong>"My tenant wants 5 spots but only pays for 3."</strong><br>
They pay monthly for additional spots or their visitors pay per visit.</p>

<hr>

<h2>When Someone Exempt Violates Rules</h2>
<p>Exemption means no payment, not immunity from all rules. If an exempt employee parks in a fire lane or takes two spots:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warning notice (not a payment ticket)</li>
<li>Direct conversation</li>
<li>Escalate to HR if repeated</li>
<li>Remove exemption in extreme cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Your parking system and workplace conduct policies are separate.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Right Balance</h2>

<h3>Good Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Employees and tenants park free automatically</li>
<li>Visitors pay standard rates</li>
<li>Clear communication about who pays</li>
<li>Simple exemption management</li>
<li>Consistent enforcement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bad Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Everyone pays including your team</li>
<li>Complicated validation processes</li>
<li>Unclear rules creating constant questions</li>
<li>Charging employees but not enforcing visitor payment</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Getting It Right</h2>
<p>Your goal is revenue from transient parkers, not from people already contributing to your property. Employees work there. Tenants pay rent. They shouldn't also pay to park.</p>
<p>Build exemption policies that protect these relationships while capturing revenue from visitors and occasional users willing to pay for convenient parking.</p>
<p>When done right, the people who should park free do park free, and the people who should pay understand why.</p>

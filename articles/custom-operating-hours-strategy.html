<h2>The Reality of Parking Demand</h2>
<p>Your lot isn't equally busy all the time. Monday at 2 PM looks nothing like Saturday at 10 PM. So why would you charge the same rate, or enforce at all, during periods when you have empty spaces?</p>
<p>Custom operating hours let you enforce parking fees only during high-demand periods. Outside those hours, parking is free for everyone. You maximize revenue when spaces are scarce and build goodwill when they're not.</p>

<h2>How to Set Your Hours</h2>

<h3>Analyze Your Current Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li>When is your lot actually full or nearly full?</li>
<li>When do you have plenty of empty spaces?</li>
<li>Are there specific days or times with consistent patterns?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Match Hours to Demand</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only enforce when spaces are genuinely scarce</li>
<li>If you're 30% occupied at 8 PM, don't charge at 8 PM</li>
<li>Focus enforcement on your top 30-40 hours per week</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test and Adjust</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start conservative (fewer enforcement hours)</li>
<li>Monitor occupancy and revenue</li>
<li>Expand hours if demand justifies it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Operating Hour Strategies</h2>

<h3>Business Hours Only</h3>
<p>Charge Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM. Evenings and weekends are free. Perfect for office buildings where parking demand drops to near-zero after hours.</p>

<h3>Peak Hours Premium</h3>
<p>Enforce during lunch rush (11 AM to 2 PM) and evening hours (5 to 10 PM), leave mornings and late nights free. Common for restaurant and retail lots.</p>

<h3>Event-Based Enforcement</h3>
<p>Only charge during games, concerts, or festivals. The rest of the time, your lot operates as free parking. Works well near stadiums, venues, or seasonal attractions.</p>

<h3>Weekend vs. Weekday</h3>
<p>Charge Friday through Saturday nights when demand peaks, leave Sunday through Thursday free. Popular for entertainment districts.</p>

<h3>Seasonal Adjustments</h3>
<p>Enforce during busy seasons (summer tourism, holiday shopping), turn off during slow months. Adapts to your actual traffic patterns.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Limited Hours</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher compliance:</strong> People understand and accept fees during busy times. They resent them during slow times.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced complaints:</strong> "Why am I paying when the lot is empty?" disappears.</li>
<li><strong>Goodwill:</strong> Free parking during off-peak hours makes your property more attractive.</li>
<li><strong>Simpler enforcement:</strong> You're only managing the system during hours that matter.</li>
<li><strong>Better revenue per hour:</strong> Charging $5 during 8 busy hours beats charging $3 during 16 mixed hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Communicate</h2>
<p>Tell people when enforcement is active:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear signage with days and hours</li>
<li>"Paid parking Mon through Fri 9 AM to 5 PM"</li>
<li>"Free parking evenings and weekends"</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't make people guess. Transparent hours reduce confusion and complaints.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Review your lot's usage for 2 to 4 weeks. Identify when you're actually busy. Set enforcement hours to match those periods. Monitor results and adjust.</p>
<p>You don't need to charge every hour of every day to generate meaningful revenue. You just need to charge during the hours that count.</p>

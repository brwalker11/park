<p>Property owners ask us this question more than any other: Should I go with Scan-to-Pay or License Plate Recognition? The honest answer is that it depends on your property, your traffic, and how much enforcement you actually need.</p>
<p>Let us break down both options so you can make the right call.</p>

<h2>Scan-to-Pay: Lower Cost, User-Driven</h2>
<p>Scan-to-Pay systems use QR codes on signs throughout your lot. Drivers scan the code with their phone, enter their license plate, and pay through a mobile interface. No app download required.</p>
<p>The upside? Minimal hardware costs. You are essentially paying for signs and software. Monthly fees run lower than LPR because there is no camera infrastructure to maintain. Setup takes days, not weeks.</p>
<p>The downside? Compliance depends on the driver. If someone ignores the sign and does not pay, you need a separate enforcement mechanism to catch them. That usually means periodic lot patrols or partnering with a towing company.</p>
<p>Best fit: Smaller lots, lower-traffic properties, situations where you want to start generating revenue without complexity.</p>

<h2>LPR: Automatic Enforcement, No Upfront Cost</h2>
<p>License Plate Recognition uses cameras at your lot entrances to capture every plate that enters. The system automatically tracks who paid and who did not. Violators get flagged instantly.</p>
<p>The upside? True automation. You do not need someone patrolling the lot. The system knows exactly who is there, how long they have been parked, and whether they paid. Violation notices go out automatically.</p>
<p>The traditional downside has been hardware costs. Cameras, installation, and ongoing maintenance can add up quickly if you are paying out of pocket.</p>
<p>But here is what most property owners do not realize: you do not have to pay for any of that upfront.</p>
<p>When you work with us, our best-in-class technology partners cover the cost of the LPR cameras and hardware. There is no capital outlay required. The equipment, installation, and maintenance are all handled as part of the partnership. You start generating revenue from day one without writing a check for thousands of dollars in equipment.</p>
<p>Best fit: Higher-traffic lots, properties where enforcement matters, and any situation where you want zero manual oversight and zero upfront investment.</p>

<h2>When You Need Both</h2>
<p>Some properties benefit from a hybrid approach. A restaurant might use Scan-to-Pay for customer convenience while adding LPR to catch the office workers who park all day without paying. The technologies are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Start with your enforcement needs. If compliance rates above 80% will make your lot profitable, Scan-to-Pay might be enough. If you need near-perfect compliance or have a high violation problem, LPR is the answer.</p>
<p>Either way, the old barrier of expensive equipment no longer applies. With the right partner, you get the technology you need with no upfront costs, no long-term commitments, and revenue flowing from the start.</p>

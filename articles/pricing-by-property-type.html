<h2>Finding Your Model</h2>
<p>Look at your three busiest days last month. What do they have in common? That's your demand pattern. Look at your slowest days. What's different?</p>
<p>Your pricing strategy should amplify revenue during high demand and attract customers during low demand. Start conservative, measure results, and adjust.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>You want to monetize your parking lot, but you don't want to charge employees, tenants, or regular contractors. Without exemptions, you either don't enforce at all or create headaches processing refunds for people who shouldn't have been charged.</p>
<p>License plate allow listing solves this. The system recognizes approved vehicles and never charges them. No passes, no tickets, no manual overrides.</p>

<hr>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>You provide a list of license plates that get free access. When those vehicles enter, the system recognizes them automatically and doesn't bill. Simple.</p>

<h3>Who to Exempt</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-time employees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building tenants</strong></li>
<li><strong>Monthly reserved spot holders</strong></li>
<li><strong>Regular contractors</strong> (weekly visitors, not annual ones)</li>
<li><strong>Property management vehicles</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Setting It Up</h2>

<h3>Collect the Right Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>State and full plate number</li>
<li>Allow 1-2 vehicles per person (people have multiple cars)</li>
<li>Use a simple email or online form</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enter Plates Correctly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Follow your system's formatting exactly ("ABC 123" vs "ABC123" matters)</li>
<li>Bulk upload via CSV for large lists</li>
<li>Test with a few employees before going live</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build Simple Update Processes</h3>
<ul>
<li>New vehicle? Update within 24 hours</li>
<li>Keep old plates active for 2 weeks during transitions</li>
<li>Remove plates when employees leave or tenants move out</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Common Situations</h2>
<p><strong>New vehicle:</strong> Let employees submit updates via email or self-service portal. Process same-day or next-day.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary exemptions:</strong> Add contractor plates with automatic expiration dates. Set reminders to remove them when projects finish.</p>
<p><strong>Rule violations:</strong> Exemption means no payment, not immunity from all rules. If someone parks in a fire lane, that's a separate issue handled through normal workplace policies.</p>
<p><strong>Family cars:</strong> Allow it if they're regular (spouse drops them off daily). Don't allow it for occasional convenience. Set a 1-2 vehicle limit per person.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Keep Your List Clean</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review quarterly and remove departed employees</li>
<li>Build plate removal into your HR offboarding process</li>
<li>Store data securely and limit access</li>
<li>Don't share exemption lists publicly</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What Good Management Looks Like</h2>
<p>When it's working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees park without thinking about it</li>
<li>Visitors pay while your team doesn't</li>
<li>You're not processing refunds</li>
<li>Vehicle updates happen quickly</li>
<li>No physical passes to manage</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Quick Start Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Decide who qualifies</li>
<li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Collect plate data</li>
<li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Enter and test</li>
<li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Go live, monitor closely</li>
</ul>
<p>After setup, it's just maintenance - adding new hires, removing departures, handling occasional vehicle changes.</p>
<p>Your parking lot should generate revenue from visitors without penalizing your team. License plate allow listing makes that happen automatically.</p>

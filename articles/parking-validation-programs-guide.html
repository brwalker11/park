<p>Parking validation solves a common business challenge: how to offer free customer parking while preventing non-customers from using the lot as free all-day parking. The solution charges everyone by default but provides validation codes to legitimate customers, making their parking free while capturing revenue from everyone else.</p>
<p>This works particularly well in high-demand parking areas where non-customers regularly use business lots without patronizing the business.</p>

<h2>How Parking Validation Works</h2>
<p>All parking starts as paid, but customers receive codes that waive charges.</p>
<p>Drivers scan a QR code or their license plate is captured when entering. Customers receive validation codes at checkout, on receipts, or through point-of-sale systems. Customers enter codes via text, web portal, or app. The system applies free parking. Non-validated users pay standard rates.</p>
<p>The technology handles everything automatically through existing checkout processes.</p>

<h2>Technology Options for Validation</h2>
<p><strong>License Plate Recognition (LPR)</strong> captures plates automatically. Customers validate by entering their plate number and validation code through web portal or text message.</p>
<p><strong>Scan-to-Pay validation</strong> has customers scan QR codes when parking. At checkout, they enter validation codes to waive charges.</p>
<p><strong>Point-of-sale integration</strong> automatically validates parking based on transaction data without requiring customer action.</p>
<p><strong>Time-limited validation</strong> provides free parking for specific duration of 2-3 hours rather than unlimited time.</p>

<h2>When Validation Makes Sense</h2>
<p>Validation programs work best when businesses experience high non-customer parking usage, operate in urban or commercial locations, have adequate parking capacity to serve customers first, and typical customer visits of 30 minutes to 2 hours are shorter than all-day parker needs.</p>

<h2>Validation vs. Other Approaches</h2>
<p><strong>Compared to time-based free parking:</strong> Validation provides unlimited free time to customers while charging non-customers immediately. Time-based systems charge everyone after the free window.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to after-hours parking:</strong> Validation operates during business hours addressing non-customer use. After-hours monetizes closed periods.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to allow-listing:</strong> Validation works for one-time customers. Allow-listing requires knowing plates in advance.</p>

<h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
<p><strong>Customer communication:</strong> Clear signage explaining the validation process prevents confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Validation code distribution:</strong> Decide whether codes appear on receipts, are provided verbally, or integrate through POS systems.</p>
<p><strong>Validation window timing:</strong> Most businesses offer 2-3 hours free parking, accommodating typical visits.</p>
<p><strong>Staff training:</strong> Employees need to understand the process and assist customers with questions.</p>
<p><strong>Exception handling:</strong> Establish procedures for customers who forget to validate or experience technical issues.</p>

<h2>Pricing for Non-Validated Parking</h2>
<p>Rates should discourage non-customer use without creating customer relations issues if someone forgets to validate. Typical approaches include hourly rates of $2 to $5 per hour or daily maximums of $15 to $25 that align with nearby parking garage rates.</p>

<h2>Common Challenges</h2>
<p><strong>Customer confusion:</strong> Clear signage and staff training minimize forgotten validations.</p>
<p><strong>Technical problems:</strong> Systems should allow quick manual overrides when validation codes fail.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive concerns:</strong> Businesses must weigh revenue from non-customers against any customer friction.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Businesses exploring validation programs should start by documenting current parking lot usage. Count vehicles that park but do not patronize the business. This data reveals whether non-customer parking is significant enough to justify validation implementation.</p>

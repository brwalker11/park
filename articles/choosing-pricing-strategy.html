<h2>Time-Based Pricing: The Predictable Approach</h2>
<p>Time-based pricing adjusts rates according to predetermined schedules. Different rates for morning rush, business hours, evening rush, and overnight. It's the same price every Monday at 8 AM, every Wednesday at 2 PM.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Office buildings, retail centers, downtown parking where demand follows predictable patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Customers know exactly what to expect. The 8 AM rate is always $10/hour. This predictability reduces friction and complaints.</p>
<p><strong>The trade-off:</strong> You miss revenue opportunities during unexpected demand spikes.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Simple. No sensors required. Schedule your rates in your parking management software and communicate clearly.</p>
<p>Start here if you're new to dynamic pricing. It delivers 10-15% revenue increases with minimal technology investment.</p>

<h2>Demand-Based Pricing: The Real-Time Approach</h2>
<p>Demand-based pricing responds to how full your lot is right now. Hit 60% capacity and rates increase. At 80% they increase again. Spaces open up and rates drop back down.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Event venues, airport parking, high-traffic urban areas where demand fluctuates unpredictably.</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> You capture maximum revenue during unexpected surges. That random Saturday when everyone visits your retail center? Rates automatically adjust upward as the lot fills.</p>
<p><strong>The trade-off:</strong> Customers might enter at one rate and leave at another, creating potential confusion if not handled correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Requires real-time occupancy tracking through sensors, cameras, or license plate recognition systems. Software automatically adjusts rates based on current occupancy.</p>
<p>Choose this if you have unpredictable demand patterns and you're willing to invest in occupancy tracking technology.</p>

<h2>Event-Based Pricing: The Surge Approach</h2>
<p>Event-based pricing cranks rates up significantly during planned events like concerts, sports games, or conferences. You know the event is happening, you know demand will be extreme, so you price accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Parking near stadiums, convention centers, entertainment districts.</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> You capture the true value of parking during peak demand. Someone parking for a championship game will pay $75 when your normal rate is $10. They know it, you know it, the market supports it.</p>
<p><strong>The trade-off:</strong> Requires advance planning and event calendars. Not automatic like the other approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Moderate complexity. You need an event calendar, the ability to set special event rates, and clear communication about when surge pricing applies.</p>

<h2>How to Choose Your Strategy</h2>
<p><strong>Start with these questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is your demand predictable? Time-based pricing.</li>
<li>Do you get unexpected surges? Demand-based pricing.</li>
<li>Do you have scheduled events nearby? Event-based pricing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can combine strategies:</strong> Many operators use time-based pricing as their foundation, then layer event-based pricing for special occasions. Others use demand-based during weekdays and event-based on weekends.</p>
<p>The goal isn't to pick one and commit forever. Start with the simplest approach that matches your demand patterns, then evolve as you gather data.</p>

<h2>Start Where You Are</h2>
<p>If you're currently doing flat-rate pricing, move to time-based first. It's the easiest implementation, requires minimal technology, and gives you immediate revenue gains while you learn.</p>
<p>Once you're comfortable with time-based adjustments and have data on your demand patterns, you can add demand-based or event-based elements.</p>
<p>The best strategy is the one you'll actually implement and maintain consistently.</p>

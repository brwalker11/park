<p>Parking lots within 2-3 miles of airports compete directly with official airport parking by offering lower rates for travelers willing to take a short shuttle ride. The business model works because airports charge premium rates while nearby private lots operate with lower overhead.</p>
<p>Property owners near airports can generate consistent revenue from multi-day parking without the complexity of managing a terminal facility.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Airport Parking Economics</h2>
<p>Official airport parking typically charges $15-30 per day for economy lots and $25-50 per day for terminal parking. Private lots 1-3 miles away can charge $8-15 per day while covering shuttle operations and generating strong margins.</p>
<p>A business traveler parking for a week pays $175-350 at the airport versus $56-105 at an off-site lot. That $100-250 savings motivates shuttle use.</p>
<p>A 100-space lot at 70% occupancy and $12 daily rate generates $25,200 monthly. Multi-day stays mean less customer service overhead per revenue dollar compared to hourly turnover.</p>

<h2>Shuttle Service Makes or Breaks the Model</h2>
<p>Shuttles running every 10-15 minutes during peak hours (4 AM to 9 AM, 4 PM to midnight) are essential. Less frequent service drives customers to pay premium rates for on-airport convenience.</p>
<p>Most operators contract shuttle service rather than owning vehicles. Typical costs run $3,000-5,000 monthly for a single van. Calculate whether this fits your revenue model. If you generate $25,000 monthly and shuttle costs are $4,000, that leaves $21,000 before other expenses.</p>
<p>Some lots skip shuttles and market to travelers using rideshare. This works where combined off-site parking plus Uber still beats official airport rates.</p>

<h2>Security Requirements and Customer Expectations</h2>
<p>Travelers leaving vehicles for days expect secure lots. Fencing, lighting, and cameras are required infrastructure, not optional amenities.</p>
<p>Minimum security includes perimeter fencing, LED lighting covering all spaces, and camera coverage at entry/exit points. Insurance requirements are higher for long-term parking. Expect annual premiums of $5,000-10,000 depending on lot size and location.</p>

<h2>Pricing for Multi-Day Stays</h2>
<p>Daily rates should decrease for longer stays. Charge $12 for the first day, $10 for days 2-5, and $8 for days 6+. This captures higher revenue from short trips while remaining competitive for weekly travelers.</p>
<p>Online pre-booking discounts of 10-20% drive advance reservations that guarantee occupancy. Monthly subscriptions for frequent business travelers generate guaranteed revenue while building loyalty.</p>

<h2>Competition with Airport Parking and Rideshare</h2>
<p>For trips under 4 days, many travelers now Uber to the airport. If roundtrip Uber averages $60 in your market, pricing 3-day parking at $30-36 positions you favorably. Beyond 4-5 days, parking almost always costs less than rideshare.</p>
<p>Monitor official airport rates and adjust accordingly. When airports raise rates, you can capture price-sensitive customers without matching their increases.</p>
<p>Airport proximity parking generates predictable revenue from travelers willing to trade convenience for savings, but requires reliable shuttle service and proper security.</p>

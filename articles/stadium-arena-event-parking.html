<p>Parking lots within walking distance of stadiums and arenas generate most of their annual revenue during 50-80 event days rather than 365 days of steady traffic. This concentrated demand creates opportunities for premium pricing that customers willingly pay for convenience.</p>
<p>Property owners near sports venues can generate $30,000-100,000+ annually from event parking on lots that might produce only $10,000-20,000 from regular daily operations.</p>

<h2>Event-Day Pricing vs. Non-Event Pricing</h2>
<p>A space that commands $5-8 on a regular Tuesday can charge $20-50 on game day depending on the event and proximity to the venue. Major playoff games, concerts, and championships justify pricing at the upper end.</p>
<p>On non-event days, your lot competes with every parking option in the area. On event days, 20,000-70,000 people converge within a 2-3 hour window. Proximity becomes the primary driver.</p>
<p>Lots within 2-3 blocks of stadium gates can charge 50-100% more than lots 5-8 blocks away.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Pricing Based on Event Type</h2>
<p>Regular season weeknight games draw smaller crowds than playoff games or weekend rivalries. A Thursday baseball game might support $15 parking while Saturday night football commands $40.</p>
<p>Concert parking often exceeds sports event rates. Popular artists draw fans willing to pay premium prices. A major tour stop can justify $50-60 parking where regular sporting events top out at $30-40.</p>
<p>Track event schedules and set pricing tiers for different event categories published months in advance.</p>

<h2>Managing Traffic Flow and Entry/Exit Surges</h2>
<p>Thousands of vehicles arrive within 60-90 minutes before events and exit within 30-45 minutes after.</p>
<p>Pre-payment systems eliminate payment delays. Customers pay online, receive a confirmation code, and display it upon entry. This allows one attendant to process 100+ vehicles per hour versus 20-30 with cash transactions.</p>
<p>Multiple entry and exit points prevent bottlenecks. Two entry points and two exit points can double your throughput.</p>

<h2>Season Pass and Partnership Programs</h2>
<p>Season parking passes generate guaranteed upfront revenue. Price season passes at 60-70% of total per-game cost. If single-game parking is $30 and there are 41 home games, season passes priced at $750-850 offer clear value while generating substantial upfront cash.</p>
<p>Some lot owners partner directly with teams or venues. The team sells parking as part of <a href="/articles/monthly-passes-vs-hourly-rates/">season ticket packages</a>. Partnership arrangements typically pay 50-60% of retail rates in exchange for guaranteed volume and zero customer service overhead.</p>

<h2>Non-Event Day Revenue Strategy</h2>
<p>Most stadium areas sit nearly empty on non-event days. The same lot charging $40 on game day might struggle to generate $50 total on three non-event weekdays.</p>
<p>Offer monthly parking for nearby office workers or residents at discounted rates with event-day exclusions. Charge $75-100 monthly for weekday parking, but reserve the right to revoke access on event days with notice.</p>
<p>Event parking revenue concentrates in short high-demand windows, requiring <a href="/articles/dynamic-pricing-101-part-1/">premium pricing</a>, efficient traffic management, and clear differentiation between event-day and regular operations.</p>

<p>Your parking lot is generating revenue. Now what happens at tax time? While you should always work with a qualified tax professional for your specific situation, here are the foundational concepts every property owner needs to understand.</p>

<h2>How Parking Income Gets Reported</h2>
<p>Any revenue your parking lot generates is taxable income. The key question is where you report it, because that determines whether you owe self-employment tax.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule E</strong> is where most parking lot income belongs. If you simply make spaces available and technology handles enforcement and payment collection, the IRS generally treats this as passive rental income. That means no self-employment tax (currently 15.3%), which can save you thousands annually.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule C</strong> applies when you provide substantial services beyond making spaces available, like a staffed valet operation or attended garage. For most property owners using scan-to-pay or LPR technology, the operation is hands-off enough to qualify for Schedule E treatment. But the line is not always clear-cut, so confirm with your CPA.</p>

<h2>Deductions That Offset Your Revenue</h2>
<p>Parking lot ownership comes with a solid list of deductible expenses. Many of these are costs you are already paying: technology and service fees, signage, insurance, property taxes allocated to the parking area, lighting and electricity, snow removal, lot maintenance, striping and pavement repairs, security cameras, and professional fees for accountants or consultants.</p>
<p>If parking is part of a larger property, you will need to allocate shared expenses between the parking operation and the rest of the property. Square footage is a common and accepted method.</p>

<h2>Depreciation: The Deduction Most Owners Miss</h2>
<p>While land itself is never depreciable, improvements to it are. Paving, curbing, drainage, fencing, and lighting infrastructure are classified as 15-year property under MACRS. You can deduct a portion of those improvement costs each year, reducing taxable income even when revenue is strong. Bonus depreciation or Section 179 expensing may let you accelerate the write-off into earlier years.</p>

<h2>State Sales Tax on Parking Varies Widely</h2>
<p>Some states require you to collect sales tax on parking transactions. Rates vary significantly across Monetize Parking's core markets. Minnesota taxes nonresidential parking at 6.875%. Texas applies 6.25% at the state level, with local additions bringing the total to 8.25% in most major cities. Wisconsin charges 5% statewide, with local additions possible. Colorado has a 2.9% state rate, but home-rule cities like Denver set their own rules.</p>
<p>Before you set your rates, understand your local requirements and factor sales tax into your pricing. Your technology provider should help configure collection, but compliance responsibility falls on you.</p>

<h2>Churches and Nonprofits: UBIT Matters</h2>
<p>Parking revenue from tax-exempt organizations may trigger Unrelated Business Income Tax. The IRS typically treats parking fees as a short-term license rather than rental income, so the standard rental income exclusion often does not apply. Parking provided for the convenience of your members or visitors may be exempt, but revenue from a lot open to the general public on weekdays likely is not.</p>
<p>Even after UBIT (at the 21% corporate rate), the net revenue from monetizing an empty weekday lot is almost always positive with modern technology that requires no staffing.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Parking revenue is taxable, but deductible expenses, depreciation, and potentially the Qualified Business Income deduction under Section 199A can significantly reduce what you actually owe. The most important step is getting set up correctly from the start. Work with a tax professional, understand your state's sales tax rules, and keep clean records.</p>
<p>Do not let tax uncertainty keep you from monetizing property you already own. With the right guidance, the numbers almost always work in your favor.</p>

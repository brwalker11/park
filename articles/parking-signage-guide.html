<p>Your signage does two jobs: it tells people how to pay, and it protects you legally when someone does not. Get it wrong and you will deal with more disputes, more chargebacks, and weaker enforcement.</p>

<h2>The Entry Sign: Your First Line of Defense</h2>
<p>Every lot needs a sign at the entrance that drivers cannot miss. This sign must include: the fact that parking is paid, the rate structure, how to pay, and the consequence for not paying.</p>
<p>Size matters. A small sign on a post gets ignored. A large sign at eye level, ideally illuminated for night visibility, gets read. The goal is eliminating the "I did not see it" excuse.</p>

<h2>Payment Point Signs</h2>
<p>If you are using Scan-to-Pay, you need QR codes visible from every parking space. The general rule is one sign per 10 to 15 spaces, placed where drivers naturally look when they exit their vehicles.</p>
<p>These signs should include the QR code, brief payment instructions, and a reminder of the violation fee. Keep the text minimal. People scan, they do not read paragraphs.</p>

<h2>What the Sign Must Say</h2>
<p>Legal requirements vary by state and city, but effective signs generally include: "Paid Parking" or "Private Parking" in large letters, hourly or daily rates, payment method and instructions, enforcement hours, violation fee amount, and towing policy if applicable.</p>
<p>Avoid cluttering the sign with terms and conditions. The detailed policies can live on your payment portal. The physical sign just needs to communicate the basics clearly.</p>

<h2>Placement Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>Do not put signs where trees, poles, or parked cars block them. Do not rely on a single sign for a large lot. Do not use fonts so small that drivers cannot read them from their vehicles.</p>
<p>Walk your lot at different times of day. Stand where drivers stand. If you cannot easily see and read every sign, neither can they.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Good signage is an investment that pays for itself in higher compliance and fewer disputes. Spend the money on quality materials, proper sizing, and professional installation. Your enforcement depends on it.</p>

<p>The evolution of parking systems has shifted from traditional gated setups to modern AI-driven License Plate Recognition (LPR) solutions. For owners and facility managers, <strong>ungated systems</strong> mean lower upfront costs, fewer mechanical failures, and minimal staffing needs. For drivers, it’s a smoother experience, with no delays at entry or exit points and no fumbling with tickets or access cards.</p>
<p>Gated facilities once had the edge in enforcing rules around reserved spaces, monthly parking, and payments. But today’s <strong>AI-enforced LPR technology</strong> surpasses these systems by automating permit management, enabling effortless digital payments, and sending real-time alerts for repeat violations, including towing notifications when needed.</p>
<p>Modern ungated platforms go even further with features like remote session extensions, automatic reminders when time expires, and flexible post-validation or VIP parking options. Because most parkers <strong>pay for more time than they need</strong>, revenue recovery tends to improve. And for those who don’t pay, the system can instantly flag violations and issue invoices without on-site staff.</p>
<p>While gates can ensure compliance, they’re vulnerable to malfunctions and can bottleneck traffic. Some operators try to bridge the gap by adding LPR cameras to open gates automatically, but this still can’t match the simplicity of a <strong>truly gateless model</strong>.</p>
<p>The conversation around gated vs. ungated systems is still relevant. Traditional ticketing may feel familiar, but to a generation that lives on their phones, it increasingly seems outdated.</p>

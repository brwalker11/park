<p>You have made the decision to monetize your parking lot. The signs are up, the system is live. Now what?</p>
<p>The first 90 days follow a predictable pattern. Knowing what is coming helps you stay the course when things feel bumpy.</p>

<h2>Days 1 to 14: The Adjustment Period</h2>
<p>Expect confusion. People who have parked in your lot for free will not read the new signs carefully. Some will pay. Many will not, at least not initially.</p>
<p>This is normal. Your violation rate will be high during week one. By week two, word spreads. The regulars figure out the new system. Compliance starts climbing.</p>
<p>You will also get complaints. Some will be legitimate questions about how the system works. Others will be people testing whether you are serious about enforcement. Be consistent. The complaints fade once people realize the policy is permanent.</p>

<h2>Days 15 to 45: Finding Your Baseline</h2>
<p>By the end of month one, you will have real data. You will know your average daily transactions, your peak hours, and your actual compliance rate.</p>
<p>This is when most property owners start tweaking. Maybe your hourly rate is too high and people are avoiding the lot entirely. Maybe it is too low and you are leaving money on the table. The data tells you.</p>
<p>Common adjustments during this phase: changing operating hours, adjusting rates for different times of day, refining your exemption list for tenants or employees. Read our guide on <a href="/articles/flexible-parking-rules/">flexible parking rules</a> to understand all your options.</p>

<h2>Days 46 to 90: Revenue Stabilization</h2>
<p>Month two and three are when the numbers settle. Your revenue becomes predictable. Compliance rates typically land between 85% and 95% for well-managed lots.</p>
<p>This is also when you can start projecting annual revenue with confidence. Whatever you are averaging in month three, multiply by 12. That is your baseline going forward.</p>

<h2>What Success Looks Like</h2>
<p>After 90 days, a successful launch means: consistent daily revenue, minimal complaints, high compliance rates, and clear data showing which hours and days perform best.</p>
<p>The first two weeks are the hardest. Push through the adjustment period and the rest takes care of itself.</p>

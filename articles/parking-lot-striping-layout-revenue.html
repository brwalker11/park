<p>Parking lot striping determines how many revenue-generating spaces fit in your available square footage. Poor layout wastes space. Optimized striping can increase capacity by 15-30% on the same footprint, directly impacting revenue without requiring property expansion.</p>

<h2>Standard vs Compact Space Sizing</h2>
<p>Standard parking spaces measure 9 feet wide by 18 feet deep. Compact spaces measure 8 feet wide by 16 feet deep. A lot with 100 standard spaces might fit 115-120 compact spaces in the same area.</p>
<p>Mixed layouts balance capacity and usability. Designate 60-70% of spaces as standard and 30-40% as compact. This accommodates all vehicle types while capturing capacity gains.</p>
<p>Track your actual vehicle mix over 2-3 weeks to determine optimal ratios for your location.</p>

<h2>Angle Parking vs Perpendicular Parking</h2>
<p>Perpendicular (90-degree) parking maximizes spaces in rectangular lots. Angle parking (45-60 degrees) works better in lots with one-way traffic flow and irregular shapes.</p>
<p>Calculate actual capacity for your specific dimensions. A 200-by-150-foot lot might fit 95 perpendicular spaces or 88 angled spaces. Perpendicular generates more revenue despite requiring more careful parking.</p>
<p>Angle parking reduces accidents and speeds throughput in high-turnover retail operations. Office lots maximize revenue with perpendicular layouts.</p>

<h2>Traffic Flow and Drive Aisle Width</h2>
<p>Two-way traffic requires 24-foot drive aisles for perpendicular parking. One-way traffic allows 12-14 foot aisles, freeing space for additional parking rows.</p>
<p>Converting to one-way circulation can add 10-15% capacity. However, one-way flow increases drive distance for customers. Properties with multiple entrances support one-way flow better than single-entrance lots.</p>

<h2>When to Re-Stripe for More Spaces</h2>
<p>Re-striping makes sense when current layout wastes space or uses outdated sizing standards. Lots striped 20+ years ago often use 10-foot wide spaces when 9-foot spaces meet current standards.</p>
<p>Narrowing spaces from 10 feet to 9 feet across a 100-space lot potentially adds 10-12 spaces. At $8 average daily revenue, those additional spaces generate $24,000-29,000 annually.</p>
<p>Re-striping costs $0.75-2.50 per linear foot. A complete re-stripe averaging $3,000-8,000 pays back in 3-6 months through added capacity.</p>

<h2>ADA Requirements Impact Layout</h2>
<p>Accessible spaces and access aisles consume more square footage than standard spaces. Plan <a href="/articles/ada-compliance-paid-parking/">ADA spaces</a> into your layout from the start rather than retrofitting.</p>
<p>Adding 10 spaces through re-striping might trigger the need for one additional accessible space. Factor this into capacity calculations.</p>

<h2>Repainting Schedule and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Line visibility directly impacts compliance and customer experience. Faded lines create confusion about space boundaries, leading to poor parking that reduces effective capacity.</p>
<p>Re-paint lines every 18-24 months in high-traffic lots. Lower-traffic lots can extend to 36 months. Use high-durability paint or thermoplastic striping in heavy-use areas for longer service life.</p>
<p>Budget $0.40-0.80 per linear foot for repainting existing lines versus $0.75-2.50 for complete re-striping with layout changes.</p>
<p>Parking lot layout and striping directly control how many revenue-generating spaces fit your property, making design optimization one of the highest-return improvements available.</p>

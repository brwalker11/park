<p>Turning a free parking lot into a dependable revenue stream starts with understanding the real dollars going in and out of the operation. When you know the numbers, it becomes clear whether charging for parking is worth the effort.</p>
<p>This guide walks through the core math property owners use to decide when to flip the switch. You will learn how to tally true monthly costs, forecast realistic revenue, and pinpoint the break-even utilization that signals it is time to charge.</p>
<h2>1. Know Your Baseline Costs</h2>
<p>Add up what it really costs to keep your lot running every month. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintenance: resurfacing, striping, lighting, and signage.</li>
  <li>Towing, patrols, or third-party services for enforcement or security.</li>
  <li>Insurance and liability coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also important to think about the <strong>opportunity cost</strong> of not charging for parking—the money left on the table for providing free spaces. Adding these up gives you your <strong>baseline costs</strong> and an idea of what your lot needs to produce to be profitable.</p>
<h2>2. Estimate Potential Revenue</h2>
<p>Next, consider what your lot can earn. Two simple models dominate nowadays:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scan-to-Pay</strong>: Low setup cost and a simple user experience with typical compliance of <strong>50–60%</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Enforcement</strong>: Camera-based systems automatically detect vehicles and ensure <strong>80–90% compliance</strong> with minimal hardware and labor.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a <strong>20-space lot</strong> charging <strong>$3/hour</strong> with just <strong>20% utilization</strong> across an average of <strong>10 paid hours/day</strong> can generate <strong>over $3,000/month</strong>. That’s before adding revenue from violations or higher weekend rates.</p>
<h2>3. Find the Break-Even Point</h2>
<p>Your break-even point is when your total parking revenue equals your monthly baseline operating costs. A good way to think about it is the <strong>break-even utilization</strong> or the percentage of time your spaces must be paid and occupied to cover expenses.</p>
<div class="formula">
  <code>Break-Even Utilization = Monthly Costs / (Spaces × Average Rate × Paid Hours per Day × Days per Month)</code>
</div>
<p><em>Example:</em> If your operating costs are <strong>$1,200/month</strong>, and your lot has <strong>20 spaces</strong> charging <strong>$3/hour</strong> with <strong>10 paid hours/day</strong> over <strong>30 days</strong>, the math looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>1,200 / (20 × 3 × 10 × 30) = 0.067 → 6.7% utilization</code></pre>
<p>That means your lot only needs to be paid and occupied about <strong>7%</strong> of the available time to cover costs. Anything beyond that is <strong>pure profit</strong>. Once you’re consistently exceeding your break-even utilization by <strong>10–15%</strong>, your lot is not just sustainable—it’s creating <strong>repeatable income</strong>.</p>

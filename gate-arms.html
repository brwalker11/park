      <h1>Why Gate Arms Cost More Than They Earn</h1>
      <p>Gate arms require costly installation, ongoing maintenance, and frequent repairs. They also slow traffic flow, leading to customer frustration. In many cases, the cost of ownership outweighs the revenue they protect.</p>
      <p>AI enforcement eliminates these issues by allowing free-flow entry and exit while still capturing every violation and payment digitally.</p>
